An encampment — sometimes referred to as an “occupation” or “[temporary autonomous zone](https://beautifultrouble.org/theory/temporary-autonomous-zone/)” — is a tactic where organizers reclaim and take over a public or privatized space. In an encampment, inhabiting physical space is a means used to achieve change, and to construct pre-figurative counter-spaces in which protesters express new ways of relating to a place and being in community. 

Encampments — while they vary in form — are often defined by an extended temporality and require a focus on the logistics of maintaining the encampment (preparing food, creating safety plans, building and cleaning shelters). The Occupy Wall Street movement is of course a recent example of this tactic in many cities across the U.S.

One logic behind the tactic is that people reclaim space they believe they are entitled to, highlighting the greater theft. In situations where a colonial force or oppressor has invaded or annexed land from a population, an encampment may be organized by the indigenous population in order to assert their historical rights to that land. The [Mauna Kea occupation](/mauna-kea/mauna-kea.html) is an example of this.
