In the late 1980s, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was devastating US jails and prisons, and AIDS wards — which segregated HIV-positive people apart from everyone else — gained a reputation as becoming “[the New Death Row](https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/1991/oct/15/aids-in-prison-the-new-death-row/%5C).” A 1987 study by the Correctional Association of New York found that people with AIDS in prison were dying at twice the rate of non-prisoners with AIDS.

"Many prisoners with AIDS spend their last days in prison isolated and alone, far from their families and loved ones," Cathy Potler, former director of the Correctional Association's AIDS Prison Project, said. 

Jails and prisons were viral incubators that spread the disease to and concentrated it in overpoliced and criminalized communities. Inside/outside organizing models infused HIV/AIDS advocacy and education efforts in prison, and additionally connected revolutionary left modes of organizing with the daily grind of incarcerated life.

A [2014 exhibition in Brooklyn, NY](https://www.poz.com/blog/exhibition-of-prison), called attention to these exchanges. The curators, prison activists, noted of the archival materials displayed, “At least a year before the birth of ACT UP, men in a New York prison founded PEPA — Prisoners Education Project on AIDS.”

PEPA was co-founded by political prisoner David Gilbert after his close friend and fellow political prisoner, Kuwasi Balagoon, died from AIDS-related complications in 1987. PEPA was modeled after peer education paradigms that were being devised in queer communities outside prison at the time. This approach emphasized mental health counseling for and by imprisoned people  living with HIV/AIDS, and education and harm reduction approaches to drug use and sex. Key to the project’s efficacy was the fact that it was run by people in prison living with HIV/AIDS, Gilbert maintained.

“We lost many people, but we found a way to slow the spread of AIDS through inmate-to-inmate communication and education,” Gilbert wrote in [a March 2020 letter](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/opinion/letters/coronavirus-prison.html) published by the New York Times in which he compared HIV/AIDS to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The policies we are living under will be most effective when we have a say in shaping them. Allowing prisoners an active role in creating a safer environment will protect lives both inside and out.”

Prison authorities punished the founders of PEPA. Even as their work saved lives during the 1980s and 1990s, Gilbert and PEPA’s co-organizers, Mujahid Farid and “Papo” Nieves, were transferred to different prisons across New York state, and harassed and criminalized for their public health contributions.

Nonetheless, PEPA was replicated across the country. A year after its founding, women in Bedford Hills, NY, initiated ACE (AIDS Counseling and Education). Similar projects emerged in other prisons over the next few years, with incarcerated people living with AIDS playing critical leadership roles. Inside/outside organizing around HIV/AIDS not only supported people in prison — it made visible the disproportionate prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Black communities long before it was recognized by the mainstream. It also connected and expanded communities of struggle that were able to complement each other’s fights for social justice, both inside and outside prison walls.
