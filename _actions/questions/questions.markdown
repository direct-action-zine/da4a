Looking to the examples from history or from other movements, which disruptive tactics are suited for prison abolitionists in the courtroom or criminal legal processes?

What would a strategic escalation of tactics from prison abolitionists look like in the courtrooms, in jails, or prisons?

What kinds of actions are symbolic, and what kinds of actions can concretely interfere with the operation of the prison industrial complex? 

How can we use direct action tactics to target [the institutions that uphold the power](https://wagingnonviolence.org/2020/06/pillars-of-support-police-violence-black-lives-matter/) of the prison-industrial-complex to withdraw their support? 

How can we follow the lead and demands of people who are incarcerated or facing charges? How do we create pathways for direct action for individuals and families directly impacted by incarceration, as well as the larger public?
