## Solidarity with George Floyd protesters from Minneapolis Bus Drivers
In May 2020, the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents bus drivers in Minneapolis, issued a statement of solidarity with protesters who demanded an end to white supremacy and police violence in the wake of George Floyd’s asphyxiation murder by police.

“ATU members face racism daily,” the union’s statement read. “Our members live and work in the neighborhoods where actions like this happen, and where this took place, now watched in horror across the globe. The system has failed all of us in the working class from the Coronavirus to the economic crisis we are facing. But this system has faced People of Color and Black Americans and Black youth more than anyone else. More than ever we need a new Civil Rights Movement.”

“At ATU we have a saying: ‘NOT ONE MORE” when dealing with driver assaults, which in some cases have led to members being murdered while doing their job. We say, ‘NOT ONE MORE’ execution Members for #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd," bringing together those who "are willing to do what we can to ensure our labor is not used to help the Minneapolis Police Department shut down calls for justice. NOT ONE MORE! JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD!”

Some bus drivers refused to transport arrested protesters to jail.
"As a transit worker and union member, I refuse to transport my class and radical youth," one Minneapolis bus driver, Adam Burch, [told the labor publication Payday](https://paydayreport.com/minneapolis-transit-shuts-down-as-bus-drivers-refuse-to-help-police-prison-labor-replaces-meatpackers-in-louisiana/). "An injury to one is an injury to all. The police murdered George Floyd and the protest against is completely justified and should continue until their demands are met."

Prohibited by law from initiating a wildcat strike, transit workers launched a group called "Union."
