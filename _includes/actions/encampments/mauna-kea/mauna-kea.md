In July 2019, following years of indigenous organizing and litigation, Hawaii’s governor’s announcement that construction of a controversial $1.4-billion telescope on a mountain sacred to Native Hawaiians was imminent. More than 30 indigenous elders, many in their 70s and 80s, set up camp at the base of the mountain and used their bodies to block access to the road. Further up the road, seven Native Hawaiians chained themselves to a cattle guard, forming a second line of defense.

Police picked up and carried away the elders; others were taken away in wheelchairs while younger protesters wept and pleaded with police.

“Law enforcement, most of them Hawaiians themselves, moved slowly and respectfully, looking pained and conflicted as they arrested the kūpuna [elders],” reported [*Vox*](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/7/24/20706930/mauna-kea-hawaii).

After being cited and released, the elders returned to their seats in the road.

“This is all we have left, so we aren’t going to move,” veteran activist Walter Ritte, one of the elders arrested, told *Vox*. “They’re going to have to keep arresting us — and we’ll keep coming right back. The mountain represents us, all Hawaiians, so we’re not going to let them take our mountain. … We aren’t going to leave her.”

In the following days, some 2,000 people joined the first wave of protesters. The encampment, which held prayer ceremonies three times a day and included a medic tent and kitchen, gained international attention.

Opposition to the new Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) and other telescopes on Mauna Kea had been mounting for years and decades. The newest proposal for a telescope set off centuries-old tensions around land rights, colonization and indigenous sovereignty. Before the occupation, lawsuits had been filed, and environmental impact statements submitted.

The occupation of the road prevented construction crews from building the new telescope. They also halted access to thirteen already existing telescopes. The shutdown was the longest interruption to scientific activity on Mauna Kea in the five-decade history of astronomy on the mountain, reported [*Nature*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02354-5)*.* As such, the protests brought issues of land rights and sovereignty into the consideration of a new audience: international astronomers.

As scientists who otherwise supported the building of the TMT grew uncomfortable with their role in the desecration of a religious site, more than 900 astronomers from institutions affiliated with the telescope wrote [an open letter](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d34aee654c6af0001463826/t/5d5b2bab11a18000013209af/1566256044171/Scientists-Opposing+criminalization+of+Maunakea+protectors.pdf) calling on the astronomical community “to recognize the broader historical context of this conflict, and to denounce the criminalization of the protectors” on the mountain.
The letter’s authors asked fellow astronomers to consider “the methods by which we are getting the telescope on the mountain in the first place.”

“Armed or not, the military and the police have become involved in the project’s deliberations with the protectors of Mauna Kea,” they wrote. The letter urged fellow astronomers “to consider whether the future of our field is worth the damage to our relationship” to Native Hawaiians.

Today, while the future of the TMT is still hamstrung in Mauna Kea, supporters of Native Hawaiian struggles are pressuring the University of California, one of the observatory’s six funders, to pull out from the project. A petition urging UC to divest from the TMT project has been signed by 1,048 undergraduate students, 70 graduate students, 119 alumni and 266 UC staff and faculty, while an online petition has reached nearly 400,000 signatures.

There is no timeline set for construction, and the TMT is considering building in the Canary Islands instead.
