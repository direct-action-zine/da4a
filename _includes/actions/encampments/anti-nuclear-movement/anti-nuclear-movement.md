The Clamshell Alliance, which formed in 1976 as part of the antinuclear and environmental movements, utilized encampments as a primary tactic in their campaign to stop the construction of a twin-reactor nuclear energy plant near Seabrook, New Hampshire.

> “The Clamshell is a coalition of groups that came together last year after all legal attempts to stop Seabrook had failed,” explained Anna Gyorgy [an organizer with the Clamshell Alliance].

Gyorgy said that the coalition heard about an occupation of a nuclear site in West Germany, and activism in Denmark that forced the Danish government to cancel six nuclear plants there.

Inspired by the Europeans’ successes, the New England people began talking about direct action. In the bitter cold of January 1976 a 22-year-old apple picker named Ron Rieck camped for 36 hours in a weather tower. In April 1976 nearly 300 people walked onto the Seabrook site and spent a peaceful day there.

On August 1st, 1976 the Clamshell sent a small occupying force to the Seabrook site. Eighteen people were arrested. Three weeks later, the Clams returned. This time 180 were arrested. At an Alternative Energy Fair in October, the Clams set April 30th, 1977, as the date for the next occupation, determined to show up with 1800 people. “It’s cosmic,” said Gyorgy. “We said we would grow ten times and we did.”

Accordingly, on April 30th, no one was allowed on the Seabrook site who had not received Quaker training (or its equivalent) in nonviolent civil disobedience. Training sessions, which had begun in March, consisted of four to six hours of discussions and role playing to teach the occupiers how to resist provocation by the police, press, agitators, judges and jailers. People who came to Seabrook untrained were given a two-hour crash course on the morning of April 30th by the Movement for a New Society, a Philadelphia-based commune devoted to higher consciousness. A Clamshell publication, “The Occupier’s Handbook,” reflecting the Quaker orientation, set forth seven principles of conduct: no drugs, no alcohol, no running, no movement after dark, no weapons, no destruction and no violence. To ensure that no provocateurs infiltrated the site, participants were issued armbands and divided into “affinity groups” of ten to twenty. These affinity groups can still be put together within 24 hours.

On April 30th 2000 men and women came to Seabrook prepared for arrest and incarceration. Every one of them had been trained in nonviolent civil disobedience. Marching from four directions, carrying heavy backpacks, singing, yipping and hooting, they converged on the site of a proposed nuclear power plant and sat there for 23 hours. Six hundred media people had been invited; more than 400 came. In order to prevent violence, the Clamshell had informed the governor’s office and the police of its every move in advance. The Clamshell’s video crew recorded the event. On May Day the arrests began. It took state troopers from five New England states 15 hours to remove all the occupiers.
