As the [large majority of Americans](https://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2015/07/reach-of-debt-report_artfinal.pdf?la=en) face the obstacles and "chains" of different types of personal debt - court, medical, car, housing credit card, etc. - organizers have looked to using debt purchases or buy-backs as part of larger organizing goals (that also unchain people from these debts). This has looked like groups paying court fines to [recover voting rights](https://www.orlandosentinel.com/politics/os-ne-amendment-4-court-20190701-kvczfio3crcubbqgb26smhm6pi-story.html) and [free people from financial burdens during a global pandemic](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd02jwhtKSZnWnRrSekdouz8DUCUyYW_umlbpAJhadSrltD3w/viewform). The dominance of medical debt as one of the most significant drivers of financial hardship has made mass medical debt relief a goal. Organizers have used the raising of money for [large scale medical debt buy-back](https://m.facebook.com/MovementStrategyCenter/posts/1480752705436674) as a way to bring awareness and organize towards larger solutions.

One of the ways that organizers have worked to buy back medical debt is with the group RIP Medical Debt. Two former debt collectors, Craig Antico and Jerry Ashton, decided in 2014 to use their unique knowledge and position to create a way to forgive medical debt. They raised donations to buy large bundles of medical debt, and then forgave that debt with no tax consequences to donors or recipients. From this idea came [RIP Medical Debt](https://ripmedicaldebt.org/about/), which has eradicated $1,396,496,786 in medical debts so far, providing financial relief for over 650,000 individuals and families.
