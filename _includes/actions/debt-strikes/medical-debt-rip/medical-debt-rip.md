Two former debt collectors, Craig Antico and Jerry Ashton, decided in 2014 to use their unique knowledge and position to create a way to forgive medical debt. They raised donations to buy large bundles of medical debt, and then forgave that debt with no tax consequences to donors or recipients. From this idea came [RIP Medical Debt](https://ripmedicaldebt.org/about/), which has eradicated $1,396,496,786 in medical debts so far, providing financial relief for over 650,000 individuals and families.
