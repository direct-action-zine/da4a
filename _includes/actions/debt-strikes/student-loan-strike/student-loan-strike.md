One organization that has leveraged collective power by offering debtors a shared platform for making demands and taking direct action is the Debt Collective.

“Tens of millions of us are carrying more than $1.5 trillion in student debt,” reads the Debt Collective’s [website](https://strike.debtcollective.org/), on which one can track its campaign and sign a pledge. “Our debt is someone's profit which also makes it a form of leverage over the government agencies and the private companies that are extracting from us. One million people default every year.”

While a large-scale student debt strike has yet to take place, [*The New Republic*](https://newrepublic.com/article/156468/radical-possibilities-not-paying-student-loans) noted that the Debt Collective’s model for mass refusal has “already worked before.”

As Nick Martin reported, “Corinthian Colleges was a company that owned a slew of for-profit higher education institutions across the nation. Nathan Hornes was one of the students that Corinthian took advantage of in the United States and Canada. In 2015, Hornes and 14 other Corinthian victims took the unheard-of step of refusing to pay their student loans. The strike came [amid a series of lawsuits](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/student-debt-revolt-begins) filed against Corinthian by the states of California and Massachusetts, and it provided a beacon for the thousands of others who had been similarly preyed upon. In concert with these efforts, the strikers ultimately secured [$480 million](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-secures-480-million-in-debt-relief-for-current-and-former-corinthian-students/) in debt relief.”
